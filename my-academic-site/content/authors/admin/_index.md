I consider myself a plant biologist, investigating how auxin polar transport, signaling, and plasmodesmata-mediated movement coordinate cell–tissue polarity and vascular patterning across two- and three-dimensional networks, while also exploring how lipid-based chemical priming confers abiotic stress tolerance and establishes stress memory. My current work, using Arabidopsis, rice, and the common ice plant (Mesembryanthemum crystallinum), integrates molecular genetics, chemical perturbation, and quantitative confocal imaging to elucidate how auxin and lipid-derived signaling together shape adaptive plant architectures under developmental and environmental cues. I also maintain a keen interest in identifying technical bottlenecks and devising practical methodological solutions that improve experimental precision and reproducibility.
